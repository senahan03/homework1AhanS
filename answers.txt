What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merge allows you to merge multiple github branches together. Merging is usually the
less destructive option but it can get quite difficult to read the branches history 
after multiple commits. 

To rebase is to rebase a new branch onto the main one making sure that all new commits
are included in the main branch. Rebasing gives a much cleaner branch history but can 
rewrite the previous history of the main branch.
