What is a remote repository?

rmeote repository is a Git repository which is exactly like a local one with 
branches, commits and so on except that its located on the Internet or on a remote 
network so you can share whatever you've worked on your local machine with other developers.

What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merge allows you to merge multiple github branches together. Merging is usually the
less destructive option but it can get quite difficult to read the branches history 
after multiple commits. 

To rebase is to rebase a new branch onto the main one making sure that all new commits
are included in the main branch. Rebasing gives a much cleaner branch history but can 
rewrite the previous history of the main branch.
